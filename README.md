Based on a [Medium post](https://medium.com/@cryptographrix/zfs-on-dvds-as-an-insane-backup-method-9e722d30e949) by [@cryptographrix](https://github.com/cryptographrix)

Semi-automated ZFS on DVD/ Disk Image creation, mounting and management.

```

  export                 Export a disk image pool
  mount                  Mount a disk image pool
Options:

I would advise against using it in production - this is a fun little experiment, feel free to fork and adjust to your own production needs.
